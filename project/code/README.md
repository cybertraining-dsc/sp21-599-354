# Code Instructions

In an abundance of caution, the zip file of the modified data I used was not placed here. Instead I transferred ownership to professor Fox, with his permission.

To run the files, first run the pre-processing data_prep.ipynb to generate the modified images. Then run the CNN_Code.ipynb to train the network.
